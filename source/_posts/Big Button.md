# Big Button

### Background

We deal with many kind of button in our workplaces to support our job.

Be it physical, like keyboard and mouse buttons, or virtual, like a triangle-shaped `play ` button in a music application on a computer screen.

But at some point in life, we also find an unusual kind of button as well.

We see it is a quite big-sized button.
It is a button pressed just once usually for a big momentum like a product launching party or a game's start declaration.

A button which tells something big is about to take action.

A button which gives excitement for anyone who press it.

We know that excitement is a good vitamin to our mind so we can give as best as we can to do our work.

So why only have it at the end? Can we have it sit right next to our computer?
So every day we can get excited.

A bigger button that is iconic to each role in a workplace.

Software developers can press it to build the source or do `git push` to CI server.
Graphics Designers can press it to do final `rendering` process.
Accountant can press it to generate reports etc.
