## Interests

I have been interested in:

- animals conservation and nature in general
- high-tech technology
- education
- people and social life

## Industry types

 - Halal
 - Non-bank
 - Non illegal

 
## Flexibility

- Time
    I am aware that disciplince is one definitive key to success.
    But sometime there were times when I finished all work yet I had to stay anyway.
    Meanwhile, there was a good tech knowledge sharing out there that I really wanted to attend. 
    I am human and I am not machine or robot anyway.
    
- Place
    I know that best setup to get a good collaboration is by face to face collaboration. 
    But I would love if sometime I can get out to find alternate workplace to refresh my mind.
    
- Dress
    At most, I will try to fit to the most what people choose to dress in your place.
    But one thing about this is that I don't like to use uniform dress. Sorry about that.
    My favourite dress setup is a tech t-shirt, black trouser, a jacket and sandal.

## Environment

- English-speaking because I want to improve this
- Use agile methodology i.e Scrum, XP because I have learned it but haven't found a place to apply it.
- Complete team from analyst, architect, designer and tester
- Has alternate desk e.g calm and noisy 
- Easy to reach by any means e.g close to my apartment 
- Clean
- Fun
- Friendly toilet i.e has water outlet not the dry one


## Compensation

I want a compensation that beside covers for basic accomodation and commuting, it also enables me to cover these needs:

- Health care especially for eyes
- Education i.e books, courses and conferences because I want to stay updated and have relevant skills
- Gadgets i.e fixes and upgrades, as well as the new ones because by having awesome list of this truly motivates me to work
- Entertainments of my own initiative not the ones that hold by your company
