Hi!

Thank you for visiting my blog.

I hope you enjoy the contents.

Looks like you are a bit curious `about` me.

Basically I'm a human just like you.

I graduated from University at 2016.

Have been working as iOS Developer.

My hobby is reading.

I spent hours mostly doing reading.

Be it in physical or digital space.

I just feel hard not to do it.

If by chance you see me, feel free to meet me.

Bye.
