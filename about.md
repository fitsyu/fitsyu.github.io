### Pointer and The Star

In C and C++, there is something called pointer.
Like variables, pointer has value. The value of pointer is an address of memory such as 0x0011. 

To get what is there at mysterious 0x0011 location, we need to dereference it and we can do that using  * .  

That's short refresher for pointer and the star. Having known that, one should be able to understand what this blog is all about. We're going to understand together what the code actually means. That is what this blog's about.
